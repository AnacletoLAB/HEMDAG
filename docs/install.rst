Installation
============
HEMDAG is available on CRAN, through Bioconda and from source code. You can use one of the following ways for installing HEMDAG.

.. _conda:

Installation via Conda
========================
This is the recommended way to install HEMDAG for normal users because it will enable you to switch software versions easily. In addition R with all needed dependencies will be installed.

First, you have to install the Miniconda Python3 distribution. See `here <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ for installation instructions. Make sure to:

 - install the Python3 version of Miniconda.
 - answer yes to the question whether conda shall be put into your PATH.

Then, you can install HEMDAG with

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge r-hemdag

from the `Bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io>`_ channel.

Global Installation
========================
You can directly install the library via R by typing

.. code-block:: console

    $ R -e 'install.packages("HEMDAG", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")'

in your terminal. But be sure to install R properly before that command.

Alternatively, you can install the HEMDAG library by typing in the R environment:

 .. code-block:: R

	install.packages("HEMDAG");

Another possibility to install the development version of HEMDAG is by using the *devtools* package:

 .. code-block:: R

	library(devtools);
	install_github("marconotaro/hemdag");

Before running the above commands be sure to have correctly installed the *devtools* package (`link <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools>`_)

Installing from Source
=======================
This section describes how to build HEMDAG from scratch.

Prerequisite
---------------

For building HEMDAG, you will need the following dependencies

 - R (â‰¥ 2.10)

 - R dependencies

    - graph (bioconductor)
    - rbgl (bioconductor)
    - precrec
    - preprocessCore  (bioconductor)
    - plyr
    - foreach
    - doParallel

Package from CRAN
-----------------------------------
On a Linux environment, download the package source from the `CRAN repo <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HEMDAG>`_ and save it (for instance) in the folder ``pippo``. Then type:

 .. code-block:: console

	R CMD INSTALL pippo/HEMDAG_<pkg-version-number>.tar.gz

.. note::

    Replace ``<pkg-version-number>`` with the version number of the downloaded HEMDAG package.

Direct Git Checkout
--------------------
.. note::

    You only need to install from source if you want to develop HEMDAG yourself.

Below, we will download the HEMDAG sources and build them in ``~/hemdag``:

.. code-block:: console

  ~ $ cd ~
  ~ $ git clone https://github.com/marconotaro/hemdag.git

Building
--------
You can build HEMDAG by using:

.. code-block:: console

  R CMD build hemdag

This will generate the file ``HEMDAG_<package-version-number>.tar.gz`` and just install the package via:

.. code-block:: console

  R CMD INSTALL HEMDAG_<package-version-number>.tar.gz
